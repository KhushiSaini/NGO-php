<h1>Little Dews</h1>
<pre><p>   A humble initiative towards the little steps who need guidance<br>
           in their ways and an stable reached out hand towards the shaky arms<br>
           who need a support to lean on. A patient listener to those who have<br>
           experience full to be poured out , who have a book written on the ethics<br>
           of life decoded by the karma itself.On one hand we have those who lived<br>
           their life on thornes just to make the life of their significant others<br>
           beautiful and full of springs and on another hand we have those who had<br>
           started their life just now,where they don't know how to step ahead<br>
           moreover, they don't have somebody to hold their tiny little hand<br>
           when they have to jump on an obstacle.<br>
       To make those budding flowers aware of the world's atrocities &<br>
         and those trees a stable ground we provide support,<br>
                 "WE ARE HERE TO HELP"...<br>
                                                        Sincerely:
                                                       The Team</p></pre>
