<h2>  Ngo "Little Dews" was founded on 7th March,2002 and its 
 first office was setted up in the local arenas of Rajasthan. Beforehand ngo worked for the orphans of the local area as
 well as for the education of the children of labours out there. When this venture happens to spread out it met with 
 various other problems of the society i.e., women oppression, child labour, old people thrown out of their house. 
       That's why we spread our working areas and setted our working zone in the various remote areas of the 
 different parts of the country.We make sure that we work without being get disturbed by the political dramas.
 The main motive of this ngo when it merged all the orphnages and old age homes is to provide the little children 
 an experienced hand to hold on so that they can get introduced to the various atrocities of the society 
 whereas the old ones can get to revive the hues of their memories of their childhood once again
 by living it with them.So that they can get introduced to the new transformations with the help 
 of the new generations.We are awarded with various prizes and honors for the exmplary works in the 
 development of society.We have been recognised as a self established and self empowered organisation.
 Today we are working with the prior attention of 61 countries. We not only run orphanages and old age
 homes but also educational institutions which also provides higher education regarding research and 
 masters. We are also accelerating in the fund raising programmes like charity auctions and charity
 balls. Other than these we also host conferences and seminars related to philanthropy.
      With this many appereciaton we are bound to work best for the society as well as for the sake of 
 little bit of humanity that is left.
                                                                    Proudly:
